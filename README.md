This project is a console-based C++ program that simulates the backend logic of a community meal platform for students and office workers.

)
📌 Project Overview

This project is a console-based C++ program that simulates the backend logic of a community meal platform.

It is designed for hostel students and office workers who need affordable, home-cooked food from local home chefs.

The project focuses only on computer programming concepts and does not include frontend, UI/UX, or database development.

🎯 Objective

To apply basic C++ programming concepts in a real-world inspired problem

To demonstrate how backend systems work using menus and logic

To stay strictly within the scope of introductory C++ coursework

👥 System Roles

The system works with three main roles:

1️⃣ Meal Provider

Adds meals and prices into the system

2️⃣ Student (Customer)

Views available meals

Places orders

Receives discounts based on ordering behavior

3️⃣ Delivery Rider

A verified student

Views pending orders

Marks orders as delivered

💸 Discount Logic (Key Feature)

14 consecutive ordering days → 10% discount locked for 10 days

Skip 1 day → discount drops to 5%

2 consecutive orders → discount recovers to 10%

Skip 3 days → discount resets and progress starts from day 1

This logic is implemented using basic variables and conditions, without advanced libraries.

🛠️ Technologies Used

Language: C++

Interface: Console (Terminal)

Concepts Applied:

struct

arrays

bool

functions

loops

conditional statements

📂 Project Scope

Backend logic simulation only

No GUI, web, mobile app, or database

Designed for academic learning and presentation

🧠 Learning Outcomes

Understanding backend workflows

Implementing real-world logic using C++

Structuring code for multiple system roles

Writing clean, readable, and modular code
